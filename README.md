Bo-LabTool is an overplatform GUI application which helps the researchers (especially on physics) do 
their scientific experiments. By writing a few lines of lua code, you can freely control all your experiment 
devices and monitor your experiment process in real time.  It provides several abstract interfaces 
(RS232, Ethernet etc.) to operate variety of devices. The Graphic User Interface of this program is 
also implemented by Lua using IUP. An open GUI programing interface is also published for extending your 
own GUI Monitors.
